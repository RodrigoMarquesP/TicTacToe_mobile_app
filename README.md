# TicTacToe_mobile_app
A tictactoe mobile app developed with the minimax algorithm using  python and kivy

This algorihtm is a pratical implementation in kivy framework of the depth search minimax algorithm for optimal moves in a tictactoe game.  
This text will focus on the implementation, apk build and solutions to reach the ideal performance. To better comprehend minimax logics of the code, visit [the minimax project](https://github.com/RodrigoMarquesP/TicTacToe_minimax_depth_search).
